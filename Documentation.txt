1.INTRODUCTION 

1.1 Overview of the project 

Sanction screening is a control deployed by financial institutions to detect, prevent and manage sanctions risk. It is a software to assist with the identification of sanctioned individuals and organizations as well as illegal activity. Thus this project is a software which maintains a transaction management system. The bank maintains a database of the users includes blacklisted users. The software basically checks the payer and the payee of a transaction, thus sanctioning or rejecting the respective transaction.

1.2 Project Objectives 

Build an application which performs sanctions screening of payments transactions.
The interface, constraints and features of the system are given in this documentation. 

1.3 Project Scope 

This system is a software which checks valid users and sanctions payments of transactions. 
It is designed to provide security to the users for transfer of payments. Payer and payee may have invalid names, transactions may have wrong dates, wrong amounts, etc. To avoid all this, a secure software is deployed which uploads details, validates a transaction to pass or fail, screens a transaction to pass or fail.

The software will facilitate the bank employee to input transaction data from a file. The transaction details can be stored in the valid keyword format in a database. A UI is provided to show all transactions, all valid transactions and the screen tests for a particular transaction. The system contains a relational database that stores the validated transaction details uploaded by the users.
